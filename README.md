# About

Heyo! I'm Ark (aka: Arktisius, Arktiica). Well, that's the alias' I use online at least. As of Fall 2024, I have an Associates in Science in Computer Engineering.

**Pronouns:** They/Them or He/Him (although, I much prefer they/them)

**Region:** United States, UTC-05:00

**Favorite Color**: `#F0F`

I have taught myself a bit of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have dabbled in a bit of C# and had taken college courses for python, C, and C++. I have the general gist of what's going on there. I don't do as much programming/development as I probably should do.

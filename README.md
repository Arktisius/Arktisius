# About
Heyo! I'm Ark (aka: Arktisius, Arktiica). Well, that's the alias(') I use online at least. I am a 20-year-old university student studying Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. As of Fall 2024, I have an Associates in Science in Computer Engineering and am attending a 4-year institution for my Bachelor's.
**Pronouns:** They/Them or He/Him (although, I much prefer they/them)
**Region:** United States, UTC-05:00
**Favorite Color**: `#F0F`
I have taught myself a bit of JavaScript during my high school years and haven't touched much of it since. I have dabbled in a bit of C# or a Took python, C, and C++ courses in college, so I have the general gist of what's going on there. I do mess around with some HTML and Tailwindcss. I don't do as much programming or development as I probably should do.
